# MuPar

MuPar is a simple parse graph for DSLs and NLP

- DSLs (domain specific languages), like MuFlo
- NLP (chat bots) with flexible word position and closures

with the following features
- modified Backus Naur Form (BNF) to define a named parse tree
- optional namespace { } brackets to restrict a sub-parse
- allow runtime recompile of syntax for NLP / chat bots
- somewhat idiomatic to Swift syntax

graph based intermediate representation
- breaks graph loops when resolving namespace
- allow future integration with data flow graphs
- allow future bottom-up restructuring of parse tree

allow runtime closures to extend lexicon
- search current Calendar, flight schedules, etc
- integrate procedural code

allow imprecise searching
- allow different word orders
- based on minimal hops (hamming distance) from graph

allow short term memory (STM)
- keep keywords from previous queries to complete imprecise matching
- may be adjusted to 0 seconds for computer language parsing

## Modified BNF

Here is the ubiquitous Hello World
```swift
greeting ≈ "hello" "world"
```

namespace `{ }` brackets limits the symbols `hello` and `world` to `greeting`.
```swift
greeting ≈ hello world {
     hello ≈ "hello"
     world ≈ "world"
}
```
double quotes match strings, while
single quotes match regular expressions:
```swift
year ≈ '(19|20)[0-9][0-9]'
digits ≈ '[0-9]{1, 5}'
```

Alternation and repetitions are supported
```c
greetings ≈ cough{, 3} (hello | yo+) (big | beautiful)* world?
```

#### Closures for Runtime APIs

in the file test.par is the line
```swift
events ≈ 'event' eventList()
```

whereupon the source in TestNLP+test.swift, attaches to eventList()
```swift
root?.setMatch("test show event eventList()", eventListChecker)
```
and attaches a simple callback to extend the lexicon:
```swift
func eventListChecker(_ str: Substring) -> String? {
     let ret =  str.hasPrefix("yo") ? "yo" : nil
     return ret
}
```
which in the real world could attach to a dynamic calendar, or any other 3rd party API.

Here is the output from ParTests/TestNLP+Test.swift :
```swift
⟹ before attaching eventListChecker() - `yo` is unknown
"test show event yo" ⟹ ⁉️ failed

⟹ runtime is attaching eventListChecker() callback to eventList()
"test show event eventList()"  ⟹  eventList.924 = (Function)

⟹ now `yo` is now matched during runtime
"test show event yo" ⟹  test: 0 show: 0 event: 0 yo: 0 ⟹ hops: 0 ✔︎
```

#### Imprecise matching

For NLP, word order may not perfectly match parse tree order. So, report number of hops (or Hamming Distance) from ideal.

Output from ParTests/TestNLP+Test.swift:
```swift
"test event show yo" ⟹  test: 0 show: 1 event: 0 yo: 1 ⟹ hops: 2 ✔︎
"yo test show event" ⟹  test: 1 show: 1 event: 2 yo: 2 ⟹ hops: 6 ✔︎
"test show yo event" ⟹  test: 0 show: 0 event: 1 yo: 0 ⟹ hops: 1 ✔︎
"test event yo show" ⟹  test: 0 show: 2 event: 0 yo: 0 ⟹ hops: 2 ✔︎
```

#### Short term memory

For NLP, set a time where words from a previous query continue onto the next query.

Output from ParTests/TestNLP+Test.swift:
```swift
⟹ with no shortTermMemory, partial matches fail
"test show event yo" ⟹  test: 0 show: 0 event: 0 yo: 0 ⟹ hops: 0 ✔︎
"test hide yo" ⟹ ⁉️ failed
"test hide event" ⟹ ⁉️ failed
"hide event" ⟹ ⁉️ failed
"hide" ⟹ ⁉️ failed

⟹ after setting ParRecents.shortTermMemory = 8 seconds
"test show event yo" ⟹  test: 0 show: 0 event: 0 yo: 0 ⟹ hops: 0 ✔︎
"test hide yo" ⟹  test: 0 show: 10 event: 10 yo: 0 ⟹ hops: 20 ✔︎
"test hide event" ⟹  test: 0 show: 10 event: 1 yo: 9 ⟹ hops: 20 ✔︎
"hide event" ⟹  test: 10 show: 9 event: 0 yo: 8 ⟹ hops: 27 ✔︎
"hide" ⟹  test: 9 show: 8 event: 8 yo: 9 ⟹ hops: 34 ✔︎
```
#### Use Case
Here is the Par definition in the Par format:

```swift
par ≈ name "≈" right+ sub? end_ {
    name ≈ '^[A-Za-z_]\w*'
    right ≈ or_ | and_ | paren {
        or_ ≈ and_ orAnd+ {
            orAnd ≈ "|" and_
        }
        and_ ≈ leaf reps? {
            leaf ≈ match | path | quote | regex {
            match ≈ '^([A-Za-z_]\w*)\(\)'
            path ≈ '^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.]*'
            quote ≈ '^\"([^\"]*)\"' // skip  \"
            regex ≈ '^([i_]*\'[^\']+)'
            }
        }
        parens ≈ "(" right ")" reps
    }
    sub ≈ "{" end_ par "}" end_?
    end_ ≈ '[ \\n\\t,]*'
    reps ≈ '^([\~]?([\?\+\*]|\{],]?\d+[,]?\d*\})[\~]?)'
}
```
Here is a complete Par definition for the functional data flow graph, called Flo: 

```swift
flo ≈ pathName (exprs | child | many | copyall | copyat | edges | embed | comment)* {

    pathName ≈ (path | name)
    child    ≈ "{" comment* flo+ "}" | "." flo
    many     ≈ "." "{" flo+ "}"
    copyall  ≈ "©" pathName ("," pathName)*
    copyat   ≈ "@" pathName ("," pathName)*

    exprs ≈ "(" expr+ ")" {
        expr   ≈ (scalar | exprOp | name | quote | comment)+
        exprOp ≈ '^(<=|>=|==|≈|<|>|\*|\:|\/|\%|in|\,)|(\+)|(\-)[ ]'

        scalar ≈ (thru | thri | modu | now | num) {
            thru ≈ num ("..." | "…") num dflt? now?
            thri ≈ num ("_") num dflt? now?
            modu ≈ "%" num dflt? now?
            dflt ≈ "~" num
            now  ≈ "=" num
        }
    }
    edges ≈ edgeOp (edgePar | exprs | edgeVal) comment* {
        edgeOp  ≈ '^([\^]|[<][<!@\©⟐⟡◇>]+|[!@⟐⟡◇>]+[>])'
        edgePar ≈ "(" edgeItem+ ")" edges?
        edgeItem ≈ edgeVal comment*
        edgeVal ≈ pathName (edges+ | exprs)?
    }
    path    ≈ '^(([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)?[.º˚*]+[A-Za-z0-9_.º˚*]*)'
    name    ≈ '^([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)'
    quote   ≈ '^\"([^\"]*)\"'
    num     ≈ '^([+-]*([0-9]+[.][0-9]+|[.][0-9]+|[0-9]+[.](?![.])|[0-9]+)([e][+-][0-9]+)?)'
    comment ≈ '^([,]+|^[/]{2,}[ ]*(.*?)[\n\r\t]+|\/[*]+.*?\*\/)'
    embed   ≈ '^[{][{](?s)(.*?)[}][}]'
}

```
#### Future

Par is vertically integrated with Flo [here](https://github.com/musesum/Flo)
- Future version Flo may embed Par as a node value type

Bottom up restructuring of parse from user queries
- Parse tree may be discarded in favor of a parse graph
- Graph built from user queries as prevNode & nextNode edges as n-grams
- Match queries by assembling nodes middle-out from dictionary of words and n-gram edges
